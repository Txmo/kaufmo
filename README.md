## Where does the "brands"-data come from?

The data is "gathered" from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands)

## How can I be sure that the data is correct?

You can not, unless you fact-check it.

I use Wikipedia as my source, so there is obviously a chance that the data is incorrect.

If you find something that is not correct, feel free to open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Txmo/kaufmo/issues)

More important than telling me is that the Wikipedia page is correct. So please also check if Wikipedia has the data wrong and write a [comment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands) or change it yourself.

## Are these all the Nestlé brands?

Unfortunately not.

As the Wikipedia page states, these brands are only a part of the many more Nestlé-brands.

For example the german page list additional brands and the english page probably also has brands that are missing in the german. I do not have a tool that compares both pages and spits out differences and i also really do not want to compare them by hand, so for now the only source is the english page.

If you know a brand that is missing, please inform or update the Wikipedia, as stated in the answer above.

## Can you implement feature X and Y?

If you have any wishes please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Txmo/kaufmo/issues).

I will then check if I like the idea, and if I have time it might get implemented.

Please do not expect anything to happen in a short amount of time.

## Can you add brands of company X and Y?

I already have the idea to add more "major" brands like CocaCola or Pepsi.

It might also be cool to have the ability to select or deselect certain "lists" of brands. For example you could then select Nestlé and Pepsi but deselect CocaCola or someting like that. This could also enable "community-lists", which could be custom made lists that are then put into the GitHub repository and made available to select. These could be lists for certain countries or regions.
